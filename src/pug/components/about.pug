          |  I'm Abhishek Raj. And My passion is to invent and build enjoyable, useful, and novel user interfaces at the cusp of hardware and software. I am a proficient front-end and mobile web engineer with experience leading and handling small teams. In my projects, I tend to gravitate to web technologies because of the flexibility of the web platform.

But let me tell you one more thing just right here, When I'm not riding cycle and playing with my pets I must be finishing one more book from my bucket list.
